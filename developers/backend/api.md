# API

_The OpenAPI spec is a language-agnostic, machine-readable document that describes all of the APIâ€™s endpoints, parameter and response schemas, security schemes, and metadata. It empowers developers to discover available operations, validate requests and responses, generate client libraries, and power interactive documentation tools._

You can download the [latest version of the API definition](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare/releases/latest/download/datashare_openapi.json) in JSON or explore an instantly browsable, developer-friendly interface [with Redoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare/releases/latest/download/datashare_openapi.json).
