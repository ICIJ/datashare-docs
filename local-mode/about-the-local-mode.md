# About the local mode

In **local mode**, Datashare provides a self-contained software application that users can install and run on their own local machines.&#x20;

The software allows users to search into their documents **within their own local environment**, without relying on external servers or cloud infrastructure.&#x20;

This mode offers enhanced **data privacy and control**, as the datasets and analysis remain entirely within the user's own infrastructure.
