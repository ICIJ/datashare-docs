# About the local mode

In **local mode**, Datashare provides a self-contained software application that users can install and run on their own local machines. The software allows users to search into their documents within their own local environments, without relying on external servers or cloud infrastructure. This mode offers enhanced data privacy and control, as the datasets and analysis remain entirely within the user's own infrastructure.
