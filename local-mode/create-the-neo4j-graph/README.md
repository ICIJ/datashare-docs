# Create the neo4j graph

## Prerequisites

### Get neo4j up and running

Follow the instructions of the [dedicated FAQ page](../../usage/faq/general/how-to-run-neo4j.md) to get neo4j up and running.

We recommend using a **recent release** of Datashare (`>= 13.9.2`) to use this feature, click on the
'**Other platforms and versions'** button when downloading to access versions if necessary.

### Add entities
 
If it's not done yet [analyze your documents](../analyze-documents.md) and extract both names of people, organizations and locations **as well as** email addresses.

**If your project contains email documents, make sure to also extract email addresses**. 


## Next step

**You can now [run Datashare with the neo4j plugin](run-datashare-with-the-neo4j-plugin.md) !**
