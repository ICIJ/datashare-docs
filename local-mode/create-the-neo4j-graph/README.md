# Neo4j

## Prerequisites

### Get Neo4j up and running

Follow the instructions of the [dedicated FAQ page](../../usage/faq/general/how-to-run-neo4j.md) to get Neo4j up and running.

We recommend using a **recent release** of Datashare (`>= 14.0.0`) to use this feature, click on the '**Other platforms and versions'** button when downloading to access versions if necessary.

### Add entities

If it's not done yet [find entities](../find-entities.md) and extract names of people, organizations and locations **as well as** email addresses.

**If your project contains emails, make sure to also extract email addresses**.

## Next step

You can now [run Datashare with the Neo4j plugin](run-datashare-with-the-neo4j-plugin.md).
