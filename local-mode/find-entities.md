{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Select your **options**

* Select a **project** where you want to find entities
* Choose between finding names of people, organizations and locations or finding email addresses. You cannot do both simultaneously, you need to do one after the other, no matter the order.
* Choose a **Natural Language Processing model**, that is to say the software which will run the entity recognition. If you want to add more models, you can check [how to add them as extensions](plugins-and-extensions.md).&#x20;

Once they are done, you can click '**Delete done tasks**' to stop displaying tasks that are completed.
{% endstep %}

Explore your **entities** in the documents

You can now start searching your entities in the documents without having to wait for all tasks to be done.&#x20;

In the menu, click '**Search'** > **'Documents'** and open the **'Entities' tab** of your documents or use the **Entities filters**.
