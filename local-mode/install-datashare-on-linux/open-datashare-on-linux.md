# Start Datashare

Start Datashare by launching it from the command-line: 

```
datashare
```

Datashare should now automatically open in your default internet browser. If it doesnâ€™t, 
type "[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)" in your browser. Datashare **must be accessed from your internet browser** (Firefox, Chome, etc), even though it works offline without Internet connection (see: [Can I use Datashare with no internet connection?](/faq-general/can-i-use-datashare-with-no-internet-connection)).

It's now time to [add documents to Datashare](/linux/add-documents-to-datashare-on-linux).
