# Start Datashare

Start Datashare by launching it from the command-line:

```
datashare
```

**Datashare should now automatically open in your default internet browser.** If it doesnâ€™t, type '[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)' in your browser.&#x20;

Datashare **must be accessed from your internet browser** (Firefox, Chome, etc), even though it works offline without Internet connection (see: [Can I use Datashare with no internet connection?](../../usage/faq/general/can-i-use-datashare-with-no-internet-connection.md)).

It's now time to [add documents to Datashare](add-documents-to-datashare-on-linux.md).
