# Start Datashare

Open the Windows main menu at the left of the bar at the bottom of your computer screen and click on '**Datashare'**. (The numbers after 'Datashare' just indicate which version of Datashare you installed.)

A window called 'Terminal' will have opened, showing the progress of opening Datashare. **Do not close this black window as long as you use Datashare**.

**Keep this Terminal window open as long as you use Datashare.**

**Datashare should now automatically open in your default internet browser.**\
If it doesnâ€™t, type '[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)' in your browser.&#x20;

Datashare **must be accessed from your internet browser** (Firefox, Chome, etc), even though it works offline without Internet connection (see FAQ: [Can I use Datashare with no internet connection?](../../usage/faq/general/can-i-use-datashare-with-no-internet-connection.md)).
