# I see entities in the filters but not in the documents

Datashare's filters keep the entities (people, organizations, locations, e-mail addresses) previously found.

"Old" named entities can remain in the filter of Datashare, even though the documents that contained them were removed from your Datashare folder on your computer later.

In the future, removing the documents from Datashare before indexing new ones **will remove the entities of these documents too**. They won't appear in the people, organizations or locations' filters anymore. To do so, you can follow [these instructions](../general/can-i-remove-a-document-from-datashare.md).
