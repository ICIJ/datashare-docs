# What if Datashare says 'No documents found'?

* If you were able to see documents during your current session, you might have active filters that prevent Datashare from displaying documents, as no document might correspond to your current search. You can check in your URL if you see active filters and if you're comfortable with the possibility of losing your previously selected filters, open the menu > 'Search' > 'Documents', open the search breadcrumb on the left of the search bar, click '**Clear filters'**.

* You may not have added documents to Datashare yet. Check how to add documents for [Mac](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-mac/add-documents-to-datashare-on-mac.md), [Windows](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-windows/add-documents-to-datashare-on-windows.md) or [Linux](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-linux/add-documents-to-datashare-on-linux.md).
* In '**Tasks**' > '**Documents**', in the **Progress** column, if some tasks are not marked as 'Done', **please wait for all tasks to be done**. Depending on the number of documents you added, it can take multiple hours.
