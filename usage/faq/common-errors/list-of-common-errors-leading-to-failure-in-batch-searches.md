# List of common errors leading to "failure" in Batch Searches

## SearchException: query='AND ada'

**One or several of your queries contains syntax errors**.

It means that you wrote one or more of your queries the wrong way with some characters that are reserved as operators: [**read the list of syntax errors by clicking here**](../../batch-search-documents.md).

**You need to correct the error(s) in your CSV** and re-launch your new batch search with a CSV that does not contain errors. [Check how to create a batch search](../../batch-search-documents.md).

Datashare **stops at the first syntax error**. It reports only the first â€‹error. You might need to **check all your quferies** as some errors can remain after correcting the first one.

Example of a syntax error message:

## elasticsearch: Name does not resolve

If you have a message which contain '_elasticsearch: Name does not resolve_', it means that Datashare can't make Elastic Search, its search engine, work.

In that case, you need to **re-start Datashare**: check how for [Mac](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-mac/open-datashare-on-mac.md), [Windows](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-windows/open-datashare-on-windows.md) or [Linux](../../../local-mode/install-datashare-on-linux/open-datashare-on-linux.md).

Example of a message regarding a problem with ElasticSearch:

_SearchException: query='lovelace' message='org.icij.datashare.batch.SearchException: java.io.IOException: elasticsearch: Name does not resolve'_
