# What are NLP pipelines?

Pipelines of Natural Language Processing are tools that **automatically identify entities** in your documents. You can only choose one model at a time for one entity detection task.

Open the **menu** > '**Tasks**' > '**Entities**' and [follow these instructions](../../../local-mode/find-entities.md). Select '**CoreNLP'** if you want to use the model with the highest probability of working in most of documents.
