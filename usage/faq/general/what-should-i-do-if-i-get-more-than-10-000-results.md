# What should I do if I get more than 10,000 results?

In Datashare, for technical reasons, it is not possible to open the 10,000th document.

_Example:_ you search for "Paris", you get 15,634 results. You'd be able to see the first 9,999th results but no more. This also happens if you didn't run any search.

As it is not possible to fix this, here are some tips:

* [**Refine your search**](../../filter-documents.md): use filters to narrow down your results and ensure you have less than 10,000 matching documents
* **Change the** **sorting of your results**: use 'creation date' or 'alphabetical order' for instance, instead of the sorting by default which corresponds to a relevance scoring
* **Search your query in a** [**batch search**](../../batch-search-documents.md)**:** you will get all your results either on the batch search results' page or, by downloading your results, in a spreadsheet. From there, you will be able to open and read all your documents
