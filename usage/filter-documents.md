## Filters

Open '**Filters**' on the left of the search bar:

**'Indexing dates'** arethe dates when the documents were added to Datashare.

**'Extraction levels'** regard embedded documents:

* The 'file on disk' is level zero
* If a document is attached to (or contained in) a file on disk, its extraction level is '1st'
* If a document is attached to (or contained in) a document itself contained in a file on disk, its extraction level is '2nd'
* And so on

## Filter by entities

If you asked Datashare to '**Find entities**' and the task was complete, you will see names of people, organizations, locations and e-mail adresses in the filters. These are the entities **automatically detected by Datashare:**

## Exclude filters

Tick the '**Exclude**' checkbox to select all items except those selected.

In the search breadcrumb, you see that the excluded filters are **strikethrough**:

## Contextualize filters

In most filters, tick '**Contextualize'** to **update the number of documents indicated in the filters so they reflect the results**.&#x20;

The filter will only count what you selected, it will reflect the results of your current selection:
