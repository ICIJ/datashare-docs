# Filter documents

## Apply filters

On the left column, you can apply **filters** by ticking them, like 'Portable Document Format (PDF)' in File Types and 'English' in Languages in the example below:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-21 at 11.29.18.png>)

A reminder of the currently applied filters, as well as your queried terms, are displayed at the top of the results' column. You can easily unselect these filters from there by clicking them or clear all of them:

The currently available filters are:

* **Projects:** if you have more than one project, you can select several of them and run searches in multiple projects at once.
* **Starred**: If you have starred documents, you can easily find them again.
* **Tags**: If you wrote some tags, you will be able to select and search for them.
* **Recommended by:** available only on server (collaborative) mode, this functionality helps you find the document recommended by you and/or others.
* **File type**: This is the 'Content type' of the file (Word, PDF, JEPG image, etc.) as you can read it in a document's 'Tags & Details'.
* **Creation dates:** the calendar allows you to select a single creation date or a date range. This is when the document was created as it is noticed in their properties. You can find this in a document's 'Tags & Details'.
* **Languages**: Datashare detects the main language of each document.
* **People / Organizations / Locations**: you can selected these named entities and search them.
* **Path**: This is the location of your documents as it is indicated in your original files (ex: desktop/importantdocuments/mypictures). You can find this in a document's 'Tags & Details'.
* **Indexing date**: This date corresponds to when you indexed the documents in Datashare.
* **Extraction level**: This regards embedded documents. The file on disk is level zero. If a document (pictures, etc) is attached or contained in a file on disk, extraction level is “1st”. If a document is attached or contained in a document itself contained in a file on disk, extraction level is “2nd”, etc.



Filters can be **combined together and combined with searches** in order to refine results.

## Filter by named entities

If you have asked Datashare to '**Find people, organizations and locations'**, you can see names of individuals, organizations and locations in the filters. These are the named entities **automatically detected by Datashare.**

Search for named entities in the filter's search bar:

Select all of them, one or several of them to filter the documents that mention them:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-21 at 11.42.17.png>)

## Use the 'Exclude' button

If you want to select all items except one or several of them, you can use the '**Exclude button'**.

It allows you to search for all documents which do not correspond to the filter(s) you selected, that is to say to the currently strikethrough filters.

## Contextualize filters

In several filters, you can tick '**Contextualize'** : this will **update the number of documents indicated in the filters in order to reflect the results**. The filter will only count what you selected.

In the example below, the 'Contextualize' checkboxes are not ticked:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-21 at 12.32.04.png>)

After the Contextualize button in Tags filter is ticked:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-21 at 12.32.14 (1).png>)

After the Languages button in Tags filter is ticked:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-04-21 at 12.32.22.png>)

## Clear all filters

To reset all filters at the same time, click 'Clear all':
